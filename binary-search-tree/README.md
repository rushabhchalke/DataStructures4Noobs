# Binary Search Trees (BSTs)
A Binary Search Tree is an important data structure in computer science.

This certain BST is a Balanced BSTs (or a Sorted BST).

## BSTs Complexity
 - Get Method = O(log n), Worst Case = O(n)
 - Set Method = O(log n), Worst Case = O(n)
 - Remove Method = O(log n), Worst Case = O(n)

Basically, most operations on a Balanced BST is O(log n) which is good.
